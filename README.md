# Machine Learning Application for House Price Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices using socioeconomic and housing-related features.
The objective is to develop reliable predictive models that support data-driven decision-making for investors, analysts, and policymakers.

## Problem Statement
House price prediction is a complex task due to non-linear relationships between location, demographics, and economic indicators.
This project explores multiple machine learning approaches to model these interactions and improve predictive accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of housing-related attributes, including:
- Median income
- Housing age
- Population density
- Geographic indicators
- Housing value metrics

## Methods & Models
The following techniques were implemented:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Hierarchical Clustering (HC)

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Prediction accuracy
- Error-based metrics
- Comparative performance analysis across models

Results show that ensemble-based models, particularly Random Forest, consistently outperformed baseline models in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Contribution
This project was developed collaboratively.

My individual contributions include:
- Designing and implementing data preprocessing pipelines
- Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction
- Training, tuning, and evaluating machine learning models
- Analyzing results and comparing model performance
- Creating visualizations to communicate insights effectively

## Notes
A detailed project report (PDF) is included in the `docs/` directory for documentation and reference.
The primary focus of this repository is on practical implementation, experimentation, and model evaluation.
